        <h2>Italian Wedding Cookies (also called Anginetti) are a round, doughnut-shaped, or knot-shaped cookie originating in the Basiliicata region of southern Italy. Traditionally flavored with anise, this cookie is quite adaptable and can be flavored with things like almond, vanilla, or lemon instead! </h2>
        <h3><strong>Ingredients:</strong> [Yield - 30 cookies]</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>113g [1/2 cup/8 tbsp] unsalted butter, softened
            <li>100g sugar</li>
            <li>6g [1.5 tsp] anise extract <em>(Try vanilla, almond, lemon, or orange insead!)</em></li>
            <li>281g all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1.5g salt</li>
            <li>8g banking powder</li>
            <li>150g [3] eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Icing:</p> 
        <ul>
            <li>240g powdered sugar</li>
            <li>30g [2-3 tbsp] milk</li>
            <li>4g [1 tsp] same extract as above</li>
            <li><em>Optional:</em>food coloring, non-pareils</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the baking powder, salt, and flour in a small bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>Using an electric mixer, combine sugar and butter on medium speed for about 2 minutes until light and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, until combined and then add the extract and mix until combined.</li>
            <li>Add the dry mixture and combine slowly just until mixed.</li>
            <li>Using a tablespoon, roll the dough into balls and place onto a parchment lined baking sheet, about 1 inch apart.</li>
            <li>Chill the cookie dough in the refrigerator for <strong>at least 1 hour</strong> before baking.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350Â°F and then bake for 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Icing:</strong> Mix the ingredients for the icing, adding the milk one tablespoon at a time. I prefer to use a teaspoon and pour a bit of frosting over the cooled cookies but some like to dunk their cookies in the frosting to frost. <em>Make sure that the cookies are completely cooled before frosting. Otherwise, the frosting will just drip off.</em> Add non-pareils while icing is still wet or they won't adhere.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The dough can be a little sticky. You can wet your hands a bit to help with rolling or if you have cooking spray, spray your hands lightly to help facilitate rolling the cookies. Alternatively, use a cookie scoop.</p>
