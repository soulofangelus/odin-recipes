        <h2>Snowball cookies (also called Mexican wedding cookies or Russian tea cakes) are a round buttery cookie often eaten around Christmas time in the United States. It's a simple recipe consisting of a basic dough that once baked is twice rolled in powdered sugar to give the impression of a snowball!</h2>
        <h3><strong>Ingredients:</strong> [Yield - 36 cookies]</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>226g [1 cup/16 tbsp] unsalted butter, softened
            <li>90g powdered sugar</li>
            <li>8g [2 tsp] pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>281g all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>.75g salt</li>
            <li>Optional: 100g pecans (or other nut), finely chopped and toasted<em>[I prefer walnuts]</em></li>
            </ul>
        <p>Coating:</p> 
        <ul>
            <li>150g powdered sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl using a handheld mixer or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter for 1 minute on medium speed until completely smooth and creamy. Add 90g powdered sugar and beat on medium high speed until combined and creamy. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. Next, beat in the vanilla extract on medium-high speed until combined. Switch to low speed and slowly add the flour and salt. The dough will look dry and you may not think the flour will fully combine. Once all of the flour is added, turn the mixer up to high speed. The dough will come together. Finally, beat in the chopped pecans, if using.</li>
            <li>Cover the cookie dough tightly and chill in the refrigerator for <strong>at least 30 minutes</strong> and up to 3 days. (If chilling for 3+ hours, make sure you let the cookie dough sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before rolling into balls. The cookie dough will be very stiff after being in the refrigerator for that long.) <em>I find that chilling the dough before baking, but after forming gives the best results.</em></li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside. Pour the powdered sugar needed for the coating into a shallow bowl.</li>
            <li>Scoop or roll 1 tablespoon (20g) of cookie dough per cookie. Roll into a ball and place on the baking sheets, at least 2 inches apart. Bake the cookies until golden brown on the bottom edges and just barely browned on top, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Coating:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheet, then very gently roll them in the powdered sugar to coat completely. Place the cookies on wire racks to cool completely. The powdered sugar will melt a bit and get sticky; that’s ok. Once the cookies have completely cooled, roll in powdered sugar again. This is when the sugar will really stick.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To Toast the Nuts: Spread chopped nuts on a lined baking sheet. Bake for 8–10 minutes at 300°F (150°C). Let them cool slightly. Then, give them a very fine chop with a sharp knife or pulse a few times in a food processor. You want small pieces of nuts.</p>
